*EmojiWorldBot version 1.0*

EmojiWorldBot is a multilingual emoji dictionary that uses
emojis as a pivot for contributors among dozens of diverse languages.

Currently we support emoji-to-word and word-to-emoji for more than 70 languages.
The bot features a tagging game 🐣 for people to contribute to the expansion of these dictionaries or the creation of new ones for any additional language.

EmojiWorldBot is a free public service produced by Federico Sangati (Netherlands), Martin Benjamin and Sina Mansour at Kamusi Project International and EPFL (Switzerland), Francesca Chiusaroli at University of Macerata (Italy), and Johanna Monti at University of Naples “L’Orientale” (Italy). If you need to get in touch with us, please send a message to @kercos.
